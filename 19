dec 23     I have thought that ithana naala namla maari yaarukkum aim illa nu , 1 crore ku ninaichan . BUt illa niraiya peru semma ah motivated ah irukaanga.bro
dec 24     innaikku oorukku kilambanum , athanaala HOD kitta sign vaanga pogum bothu, jayanthi ah paarthan , so she had talked to k , and she told to me .But i could not even realise . my mind pausing and then realising that. But before that 
           i had seen the senior(GK) .At that time my mind was balanced. i was literally losing my balance when even hearing about K. this is not a good sign for growth
           i need to clear this one out. what I am always having in the mind in the sense, Even when she told their name my mind was gone to the visuslisation of k in that blue dress
           Then came back to the reality. So that I need to be careful about my conciousness and presence of mind.It can  be resolved by often getting exposed to them and getting
           used to their presence. this is the only way that i could do to resolve this mindset.
dec 29    I am just reaslising and being present in the presence of classmates nowadays. this is really a weird and new one to me.i am lloking for the misateks , that i mead . it is a good practice 
          to improve myself.But i should not just focus on that .
